{
   bool result = false ;
   if (!isEmpty())
   {
      top--;
      result = true ;
   }
   return result;
}

What method is this?
push()

peek()

pop() X 

front().


2. Given the following code:

template <class ItemType>
ItemType ArrayStack<ItemType>::doSomething() const
{
   if(!isEmpty())

}

What method is this?


pop()

peek() X
 
push()

constructor()


3. If you implement a stack using an array, where should the bottom element of the stack be placed?



at the first element of the array - X

mid array for a binomial search

it doesnâ€™t matter

at the end of the array

4. A program can use the operations of the ADT stack without knowing how the operations are implemented.

True


5. In a stack the pop method returns the object at the top of the stack.
T -> F?????? 

6. If the array: // not on quizlet
6, 2, 7, 13, 5, 4
is added to a stack, in the order given, which number will be the first number to be removed from the stack?
4


7. What behavior does the stack exhibit?
last in first out 

8. What behavior does the queue exhibit?
first in first out 

9. Which of the following is the postfix form of the infix expression: (a + b) * c / d  // not on quizlet

a b + c * d /

10. Which data structure represents a waiting line and limits insertions to be made at the back of the data structure 
and limits removals to be made from the front?
Queue


11. Given the following queue operations on an empty existing queue called nameQueue.

nameQueue.enqueue(Sid)
nameQueue.enqueue(Sal)
nameQueue.enqueue(Sue)
nameQueue.enqueue(Sam)
nameQueue.dequeue()
display (nameQueue.Front())

What name is displayed?

enqueue() - X

empty()

front()

13. Which ADT would be best use to model the customers at a bakery who take numbers to mark their turn?

keeping a grocery list

generating random numbers for a game

reading a string of characters - X
