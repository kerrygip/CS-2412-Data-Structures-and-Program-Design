In a recursive solution, the base case terminates the recursive processing

Base case for a recursive definition of factorial of n is 
factoria(1)

If a recursive function never reaches a base case
infinite amount of recursive calls occurs

writeBack(in s:string)
      if (s is empty)
            return
      else
      {
            Write the first character of s
            writeBack(the string beginning at the second character of s)
      }

displays: the string s

A recursive solution solves a problem by solving smaller instances of the same problem
T

Iterative solution involves loops
T

Every recursive function must have a base case
